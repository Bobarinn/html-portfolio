<h1>Kolade's Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies on the list</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Got has been at the top of my list since 2017 and I honestly don't think that is chnaging anytime soon. I've loved other movies after seeing this movie, but they just don't come close.</p>
<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>I have seen this show at least 3 times and some episodes up to 5 times. There is this feel-good feeling or tingly I have whenever I see a clip from the show on social media and I just usually end up going back to Netflix to watch</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>When it comes to the 90s sitcoms, none come close to Friends. I love the show and I'm definetly going to see in again for the 3rd time.</p>
